            <p>The world is hurting. New Orleans is a town built on the backs of our service industry workers and they
                need our help more than ever. I’m #WritingAWrong in response to jobs lost from the outbreak of COVID-19.
                Ready to join the mission?</p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote p-5">
                <p>The New Orleans airport used to be empty. The entire city was forced to work remote for months.
                    People lost their homes and possessions overnight. Everyone’s income was stopped cold in its tracks.
                    All the restaurants closed.</p>

            <h3>New Orleans is no stranger to disaster</h3>
            <p>I love this quote the CEO of my company shared with us about the times of Katrina. He goes on to say how
                reminiscent COVID-19 is of those times… and of how much worse it’ll likely get.</p>

            <p>I’m fortunate enough to still have my full-time job - for now at least - but many of my friends and
                neighbors are not. So many places that have become my homes are bleeding and their employees wondering
                what next week or next month is going to mean for them. I’ve been giving friends food and other help
                when I can, but as I’ve watched friend after friend after friend walk to the guillotine, I’ve been
                trying to think of a way I can help… that was actually scalable.</p>

            <p>So here it is.</p>

            <p>If you’re in the service industry, I’m here to help you get back on your feet. Here’s how I can help:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Want to get back to what you were doing?</strong> I’ll touch up your resume, help with your business card
                    design, or review your portfolio so you’re ready to hit the ground running with this madness stops.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Want to try something new?</strong> I can help you create a content strategy for a new project, outline a
                    website, edit copy for a new product, or overhaul your resume for a new venture completely.</li>

                <li><strong>Need something else?</strong> I’ve got a lot more up my sleeve - let’s talk.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>There is no fee for anyone in the service industry trying to get back on their feet.</p>

            <p>If you’re not in the service industry or your income hasn’t been impacted by COVID-19, we need your help!
                I’m a seasoned and creative Digital Marketing Manager and can help your business grow and adapt in this
                crisis.</p>

            <ul>
                <p><strong>Got a website?</strong> I can help you with copywriting, optimizing it for search engines, help redesign it
                    for better UI/UX, competitive research, ghost writing, email marketing strategy and much more.</p>

                <li><strong>Got an idea or product?</strong> I can help you brand it, come up with a logo, colors, social, website, come
                    up with t short designs - the works!</li>

                <li><strong>Need something else?</strong> I have a ton of experience and connections in the marketing world and can get
                    you the help you need (even if it’s not from me).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>For anyone outside of this impacted group, my fee is $30 an hour - $25 of which goes directly to someone
                impacted by COVID-19. The other $5 per hour goes towards paying myself or another marketing and branding
                colleague for their time.</p>

            <h3>Other ways you can help</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You don’t have to get copywriting, marketing, or branding services to help. Share this with anyone
                    you know that could use some free help with their resume - or anyone that could use some marketing
                    or branding help to grow their business in these troubling times.</li>

                <li>Additionally, if you want to make a donation, 100% of it will go to people in the service industry
                    in the New Orleans area - just use the hashtag #WritingAWrongCOVID19.</li>

                <li>If you have a high school student home for the foreseeable future or you, yourself missing the end
                    of the semester and looking for some hands-on marketing, business, and leadership experience give me
                    a call.</li>
